**Game classes we would like to see implemented:**
 - Very simple games that approximate classic economics questions, such as Prisoner's Dilemma (best of 20 rounds!), Dollar Cost Auctions, etc
 - Multi-party games with variable solutions, such as Splendor
 - Co-operative games, in which multiple teams must defeat the game
 - Social dynamics / bluffing games, such as The Resistance or Battlestar Galactica board game
 
**Experiments we'd like to see related to token circulation in non-linear (e.g. quadratic or preference ranking) voting:**
 - Frequency of token distribution vs decision events
 - Distribution of tokens (fixed, random, based on performance metrics)
 - Fixed vs steadily increasing vs psuedorandom supply of token based voice points
 - Decay of votes over time (rate of decay, decay toward ideal / least preferable pool size)
 - Voting through direct payments (e.g. Vickrey-Clarke-Groves) vs voting toward central pool
